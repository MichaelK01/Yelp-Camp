### About
Proof of concept website undertaken as the main code-along to Colt Steele's 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' course on the Udemy platform. A short course report can be found above in the document titled 'Udemy Course Report'.

Yelp Camp is a simple camping reviews website, based on the concept of Yelp. The central purpose was to implement full CRUD functionality into a user friendly website designed using Bootstrap. Yelp Camp also makes use of Mongo databasing, Cloudinary Maps, and many other middlewares to boost security, error handling, authorisation, and user experience. 

All credit belongs to Colt Steele for his exceptional course, it is again stressed that this application is a code-along to Colt's videos. I have no rights to the content, and therefore accept no responsibility for it. However, some personal edits have been made to the website. User access and functionality have been restricted so that the website cannot be taken advantage of. Registration of new users has been disabled, **you may log in using 'guest' as username and password.** The ability to create, edit, or delete campgrounds has also been disabled, but the forms are still available to view. The original code has been left in the files above as comments.
